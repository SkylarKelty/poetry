The kitchen light is merciful and thin,  
A halo for the hour I wander in,  
Barefoot, half a prayer beneath my skin-  
A quiet room where mending can begin.

The kettle hums its small and patient note,  
Steam ghosts the window, wraps around my throat,  
And all the words I never learned to quote  
Unknot themselves and finally stay afloat.

By dawn the cup is empty, but I keep  
The warmth against my palms, a fragile sweep  
Of proof that even nights that do not sleep  
Can set a fractured heart back into deep.
