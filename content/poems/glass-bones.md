They told me I was fragile, made of glass,  
That every gust of wind would be my last,  
That I should wrap in cotton, let life pass,  
And mourn the future from inside the past.

But glass refracts the light in ways steel will not,  
Reveals the colors hidden in the front,  
And yes, it breaks-but shatters with a font  
Of prisms scattered everywhere at once.

I'm learning how to hold my broken parts,  
Not gluing them but making something art,  
A mosaic where the fractures are the start  
Of patterns only damage could impart.
