epigraph: "for anyone driving home too late"

Streetlamps stitch a highway through the black,  
A thread of amber pulling memory back,  
Each mile marker a soft and silver tack  
Pinned to the map of everything I lack.

The radio fades in and out like rain,  
A voice I almost know, a tender strain,  
And somewhere in the blur of glass and lane  
I hear my younger self repeat my name.

When morning lifts the horizon into blue,  
The stars go out, but not what they ran through:  
A sky of borrowed light that still feels true,  
Enough to guide a tired heart home anew.
