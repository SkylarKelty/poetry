The ironwood remembers what we broke,  
Each ring a year of fire, ash, and smoke,  
Its roots descend through earth like hands that spoke  
Beneath the weight of every careless stroke.

The canopy still catches morning rain,  
Still filters light through emerald windowpane,  
Still shelters those who never learned the name  
Of everything they set alight for gain.

And when the last tree falls without a sound,  
The silence will be deafening, profound-  
A planet spinning, wounded, tightly wound,  
With no one left to mourn the hallowed ground.
