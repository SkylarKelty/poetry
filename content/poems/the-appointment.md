She asks me how I've been since last we spoke,  
I say "I'm fine" and watch the silence choke  
On all the things I buried like a yolk  
Inside a shell that's hairline-cracked but whole.

The clock ticks like a metronome of shame,  
Each second is a letter in a name  
I have not said aloud, a careful flame  
I keep alive but cannot fully claim.

She writes a note. I wonder what it says.  
Perhaps: "Still building walls in different ways."  
Perhaps: "Progressing slowly through the haze."  
Perhaps just: "Here again. Another phase."
