The silence fills the corners first, then walls,  
Then crawls across the ceiling, down the halls,  
Until it finds the space where breathing stalls-  
A pressure only emptiness installs.

I used to fill these rooms with noise and light,  
With laughter loud enough to drown the night,  
But now I've learned that stillness is not blight-  
It's just the dark adjusting into sight.

The quiet is not absence, is not lack,  
It's every word I swallowed coming back,  
Each syllable aligned along the crack  
Where I rebuilt myself from white to black.
