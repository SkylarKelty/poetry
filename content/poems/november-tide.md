epigraph: "Margate, after the storm"
---
The sea returns what no one thought to miss,  
A shoe, a shell, a half-remembered kiss  
Pressed into sand like some strange genesis-  
The tide's own way of saying things exist.

The gulls describe their circles, gray on gray,  
While storm clouds bruise the edges of the day,  
And I stand ankle-deep in cold decay,  
Watching the shoreline slowly wash away.

There's comfort in the water's constant song,  
A rhythm that insists we all belong  
To something vast and patient, deep and long-  
The ocean does not care that we were wrong.
