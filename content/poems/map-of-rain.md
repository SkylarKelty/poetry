Rain writes in cursive on the windowpane,  
A looping script of weather, glass, and grain,  
Each droplet tracing roads of joy and pain  
That merge, divide, and find the sea again.

The garden takes the lesson without speech,  
Dark soil opening just within its reach,  
Leaves bowed low as if they mean to teach  
How thirst can turn to gratitude in each.

By evening every branch has learned to shine,  
The gutters sing, the sidewalks smell like pine,  
And I can read, between each silver line,  
A world revised by water into sign.
