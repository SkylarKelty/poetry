The god of losing socks lives in the dryer,  
A minor deity, no heavenly choir,  
Just static cling and lint and tangled wire,  
And one ambition: never to retire.

The god of almost-sneezing haunts the light,  
That tickle at the edge of wrong and right,  
A half-formed prayer that vanishes from sight-  
Belief that dies before it's fully bright.

The god of finding coins beneath the couch  
Rewards the faithful with a grateful ouch,  
A copper blessing in a dusty pouch-  
Small miracles for those who deign to crouch.
